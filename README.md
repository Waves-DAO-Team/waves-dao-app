Waves DAO is a client-server application using blockchain technology
based on smart contacts. Frontend uses Angular, Angular material and Signer.

File structure applications are:

- /pages - directory with the main pages of the application
- /ui - ui elements located here
- /services - application services located here
- /libs - directory where application libraries, pipes, decorators, directives
and more are located.

Main application services:

- ContractService - this service is responsible for interacting with contracts.
This service receives data, prepares and formats it,
as well as switches between contracts.
- InterhackContractService, CommunityContractService, CommonContractService -
services responsible for working with different types of contracts.
CommonContractService combines common contract methods.
- SignerService - service responsible for interaction with [Signer](https://github.com/wavesplatform/signer)
- UserService - service responsible for the current user, his access and
participation in grants.

## Starting project

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rieset/waves-grants.git
    cd waves-grants
    npm i
    ng serve
```

## Adding modules

You can use the following commands to automatically generate modules.

Create component

```bash
    ng g m my-component
    ng g c my-component
```

Create pages

```bash
    ng g m pages/my-other-page --routing
    ng g c pages/my-other-page
```

Create ui component

```bash
    ng g m my-ui-component --project=ui
    ng g c my-ui-component --project=ui --export
```

Create library module

```bash
    ng g m my-lib-module --project=libs
```

Create service

```bash
    ng g m my-service --project=services
    ng g s my-service/my-service --project=services

    # and create my-service.model.ts in directory service
```

## Running tests and lint

To run the tests under Node you will need tap installed (it's listed as a
`devDependencies` so `npm install` from the checkout should be enough), then do

```bash
    ng lint
    npm tests
```
